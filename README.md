# Emoji Finder

A demonstration of fuzzy search using [Fuse JS](https://www.fusejs.io/), this application allows the user to search across the names of every emojiâ€”no server needed.

This same technique could be followed to build a searchable documentation site or a prototype of a service that doesn't yet have a full backend.

Check out a video demo here:
